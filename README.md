# Goals
Submit any code needed to satisfy the requirements of the specified quarterly goal
Create a new READMe repository for each goal that should be met. Title "GOAL #", where # is the number of goal for which the goal satisfies. Explain within the Readme the code, its purpose, and how it meets the goal.
Upload your code from your preffered IDE underneath the Readme for the corresponding goal

Depending on your specific goals you may have 3 different repositories or no repositories. 


Goal #2

The files I added to the repository contain 2 HTML files that represent my Home page, and All Products page, an the other two files are CSS files that support the html.

The purpose of the files is to showcase an example website built from scratch and show the CSS can change a regular html site into something more decorative and user friendly.

This meets my goal of making the website more eye-friendly to the user.
